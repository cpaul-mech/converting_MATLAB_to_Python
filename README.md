# converting_MATLAB_to_Python
This repository shows the work I have done to convert previous MATLAB code from Doctor Dillon at Brigham Young University to using python instead. 

The best way I have found to develop this kind of conversion is to use spyder to run the code and then use the variable explorer to see what the variables are and what they contain. This allows the environment to be more similar to MATLAB.
