# Guide to The Files included in this folder:

### speedofsoundTT_Chloe.m: old code. Ignore. 
inferior version, less bells and whistles. Simpler? Probably ignore. 

### USTT_speedy_Chloe_v3.m: This is the code that I will be converting to Python. It is the most recent version of the code.
Signal to noise ratio added? Kept fixing bugs and stuff, probably the most accurate version currently. 

### MRIGFUS Python Code - Copy.py: Python code attempting to replicate the USmultiflite3a.m MATLAB code. 
Reportedly has many bugs. I won't be looking at this unless I need to. I can use it as a reference when needed.
